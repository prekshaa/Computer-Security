this file is just to explain the different versions of various files used for hw09 for ece404.
for sp21:
1st version of dot_procmailrc and GET_MESSAGE_INDEX, as downloaded from email attachment. These files have not had dos2unix run on them since it couldn't be done locally from this machine. So they were copied (scp) to pveerar@shay to run dos2unix with thinlinc.
2nd version: dos2unix has been run on them. they exist in pveerar@shay.
3rd version: renamed as .procmailrc, this is on the temp account, home folder. temp acc: ece404p0@shay.ecn.purdue.edu
on thinlinc, it still shows up after renaming to .procmailrc, but everywhere else, it just diasappears after renaming, maybe due to starting filename with a period.
